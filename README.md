# 📊 How It Works

Data Collection: User interaction data is collected and stored in the database.

Processing: The system analyzes user behavior, ratings, and preferences.

Model Training: Machine learning models are trained on collected data.

Recommendations: Users receive personalized suggestions based on predictions.

# 🔧 Configuration

Algorithm Choice: Easily switch between collaborative filtering, content-based, or hybrid approaches in the settings.

Thresholds: Customize thresholds for similarity and recommendation confidence.

# 📂 Models

```

class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    product_image = models.URLField()
    description = models.TextField()
    category = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name




class UserActivity(models.Model):
    ACTION_CHOICES = [
        ('view', 'View'),
        ('click', 'Click'),
        ('purchase', 'Purchase'),
    ]

    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    product = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    action = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=ACTION_CHOICES)
    timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.user} - {self.action} - {self.product}"


```
